# MPMB_Addons
Additions to the fanmade D&amp;D character sheet by MorePurpleMoreBetter (https://github.com/morepurplemorebetter/MPMBs-Character-Record-Sheet).

The format of the addons are per the guides provided by MPMB. Since they're fairly 'cookie-cutter' to the project and there are code length limits within the pdf, code commenting is reserved for unusual code only.

More documentation and add-on examples can be found within the original project, so I won't repeat it here (so that I don't have to worry about syncing the two).
